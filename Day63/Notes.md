## Notes
### Pull Quotes
- A quote that stands out from its surroundings
- aside tag can be used as categorization but doesn't do much. It should be used to
separate content from surrounding content that is related to it
- float is a nice attribute to use because it moves the text to one side
- having a background image (like a quote symbol) or color would help it stand out
- see other attributes in PullQuote.CSS
- note: I made a mistake while style the first letter. Put a space between the number and px so font size didn't register

### Drop Caps
- Enlarges and styles the first letter of a paragraph
- You can change color, size, weight, style, etc
- pseudo-class: first-of-type for first paragraph
