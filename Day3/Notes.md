**HTML Elements** 
<br>
ok

basic temple: \<tagname>content here\</tagname>

- some tags don't have contents
- some tags also don't have an ending tag
- some tags show up correctly without end tag but it's good practice to include end tag because not doing so can lead to errors
- html elements can be nested
    - example: \<p> in \<body> in \<html>
- \<br> is a line break. You can use it as a content
    - \<p> Hello \<br> my name is Bob
    - Displays: Hello <br> my name is Bob
- Html is not case sensitive. \<p> is same as \<P>
- lowercase is recommended tho
