## Notes
### More tabs
- [link](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_tabs.asp)
- this method requires JS 
- common js practice: put script tag(interal and external) at end of html page
- Html:
    - head(title, CSS link), body (content and JS script)
    - nav container (div works too) with buttons
    - nav with class value
    - button with class value
    - onclick attribute with openTab (or some other function name) that's going to be written in the js file
    - create section containers (or div) to contain the contents of each tab (h and p tags) 
    - each section container should have an unique id and one common/shared class
- CSS:
    - style tab
    - style button (float, cursor, transition) 
        - note that this uses float rather than changing display
        - you can inherit background color (nice)
    - style button hover state (change background color)
    - create active/current tab class (whatever that means) (style it so it's background color is darker)
    - style tabcontent
- JS:
    - hard to explain. Look at file. Better yet, look at js file in link at top of this page. 
- add animation with animation property and @keyframes thingy
- show/hide tabs by default example in link (also implemented in example files here)
- `border: 1px black solid;` to show padding and margins for editing
- `<span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'">x</span>`
- for closing tab
