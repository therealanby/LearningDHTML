**Html attributes**
- all html elements can have attributes
- provides additional info about element
- specified in start tag
- template: name = "value"

*Examples*
- \<a> defines a hyper link. the href attribute specifies the URL
- \<img> src attribute specifies the path of the image
    - different urls
    - absolute is a link to an external image. It may be under copyright and it can be removed/changed
    - relative is an image hosted on the site. Does not include domain name. Relative is best because it won't break if you change domains
- width and height for images
- alt for displaying alternate text in case image does not load
- \<p> style for adding color, font, size and others
    - style tag only works when you also have css
- \<html> lang for declaring language of site
- \<p> title. hovering over the paragraph will show the text
- tips:
    - use lowercase attributes
    - put quotes around attribute values
    - double quotes > single quotes

**Some CSS**
- covering css later but quick peak for now
- using internal and inline css
- specify css stuff in style in html tag
- make sure in the css file that the tag is specified and the style pair is inside the brackets
- check stuff.css for example
