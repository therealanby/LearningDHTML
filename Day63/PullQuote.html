        <p>To say that one has never experience the
        art of couch throwing is to say that one 
        has never eaten a piece of potatoe square. 
        </p>
        <p>If that applies to the general public, then the couch god will be depressed. 
        To throw a couch, is to celebrate the couch god's existence. To sit on a couch, is to 
        acknowledge the blessing that couch god has given us

        <p>On the 32nd of February, the couch cults get together and celebrate
            day known as couch day. The main event of that day is to throw couches to celebrate the couch god.
            The cult members will then sit on couches and eat couch cookies.
