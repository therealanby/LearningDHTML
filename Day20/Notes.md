## Notes
**Tables**
- border property
- width property
- height property
- setting both th and td have separate borders
- to avoid this set border-collapse property to collapse
- only border around table then specify it for table tag only and not td, th, or tr
- text-align and vertical align property for alignment
- padding property for td and th for space between borders
- border-bottom property with values of [px, style, color] for horizontal dividers
- add :hover after tr to set highlight when mouse hovers over the row
    - example: tr:hover {background-color: [color here];}
- add :nth-child([even or odd]) to alternate row color
    - example: tr:nth-child(odd) {background-color: [color];} 
- you can set background-color and color property for most table elements
- put the table in a div container, give the container a class/id and put a selector for that class in the stylesheet. Put overflow-x:auto inside the body

**Display property**
- display property
- value: block, inline - switches between the two types 
- block starts on new line and takes up all the width
- inline starts on same line and takes up necessary space
- display: none - display the element as if it's not there and makes it invisible
- visibility: hidden -hides an element but the space it takes up stays as empy space
