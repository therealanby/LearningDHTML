## Notes
**Variables**
- variables exist to store data
- they are declared with the keyword "var"
- const keyword for variable that can't be reassigned
- let keyword defines a variable in a restricted scope
- assign strings with "" and numbers usin numbers
- variables work simiarly to variables in other languages. You don't need to define the type, just use var which will infer the type

**Variables Scopes**
- global and function scope
- global variables are declared outside of functions
- function variables are declared inside functions
- var variables can be used outside of their block
- let variables cannot
- redeclaring a variable with let inside a function will not change the value of the variable outside

**Const**
- cannot be reassigned
- if it's an object(like an array or collection of variables), the individual values can be changed

**operators**
