## Notes
### Tabbed Navigation (using Float)
- [link](https://www.htmldog.com/techniques/tabs/)
- Continuation of previous day except slightly adjusting the tabs so that they float
- word-wrap: break-word; is a useful css property to make words wrap around in case it is too big to fit the screen
- change nav li and have it include stuff so it would work with the float property
- instead of displaying inline, it floats the boxes to the left
- this breaks stuff so more adjustments need to be make
- clear property separates the boxes (tab from content box)
- top: 1 pushes down tab to cover content box (overlaps white to make it look connected)
- display: inline-block can also be used (not covered here)
