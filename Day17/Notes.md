## Notes
**Box model**
- box model is a term used to talk about design and layout
- a box model is something that wraps around every HTML element
- it's made up of: margin, border, padding and the content
    - margin: area outside border; transparent
    - border: a border that goes around padding and content
    - padding: clears an area around content. transparent
    - content: content of box; image/text
- setting the width property only sets the width of the content
- calculations for total width/height:
    - width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin
    - height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin

**Outlines**
- a line drawn outside the element's borders
- drawn around element, outside borders; used to make element stand out
- outline properties:
    - outline-style
    -...-color
    -...-width
    -...-offset
    - outline
- different from borders
    - drawn outside border
    - may overlap
    - not part of element's dimension
    - doesn't contribute to total width/height calculations
- outline-style
    - values:
        - dotted
        - dashed
        - solid
        - basically all border values
- outline-width
    - thickness of outline
    - thin, medium, thick
    - specific size: px
- outline-color
    - colors
    - invert: performs inversion and also makes outline visible always
- shorthand
    - order: width, style(required), color
- offset    
    - adds space between outline and border of an element
    - "outline-offset"
    - value is a measurement unit(usually px)
