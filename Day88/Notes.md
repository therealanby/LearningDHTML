### Dropdowns
- [link](https://www.htmldog.com/techniques/dropdowns/)
- dropdown menus are sub-navigation lists that appear only after you hover your cursor over it
- the structure of dropdowns are based off lists. nest-lists for nested dropdowns
- list elements are links
- have links for primary categories to accomdate for people not using mouses
- use display and :hover to make the "dropdown" work
- add borders and style to make it look better
- more detail on further nested dropdowns in link
