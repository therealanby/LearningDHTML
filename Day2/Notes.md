# Notes

1. Notes for Example.html

- \<!DOCTYPE html> defines this document as a html5 document
- \<html> root element of html page
- \<head> meta information about page
- \<title> title for page. appears in tab 
- \<body> document body. should contain all visible things such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, ...
- \<h1> large heading
- \<p> paragraph
- \<br> for creating new lines

ok so, 
- All html documents must start with \<!DOCTYPE html>
- The document itself must be inside \<html>
- All visible parts belong in \<body>

### Headings
- \<h1>
- \<h6>
- h1 is biggest and h6 is smallest heading. headings 1-6 can be used

### Links
- \<a href = "[insert link here]"> text for link \</a>
- \<a> is the tag name I guess
- href is an attribute
- attributes provide more information about the tag
- href specifies the link location

### Images
- \<img scr = "[image link]" alt = "[link]" width = "100" height = "100" >
- no need for ending tag (\</img>)
- src is source file, alt is alternative text, width and height are self-explanatory

Headings, links and images are practiced in Practice.html
